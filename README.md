# challenge-1

## Description

I wanted to work with the preexisting HTML and CSS of the Horiseon website to achieve accessability standards. Through editing the code, I gave the site a more easily searchable title, consolidated repetivive CSS blocks, added alt attributes to images so they could be read by screenreaders, and changed semantic tags in the HTML document so it was more apparent what each section of code was referring to.
